# Milestone 2: Closed Loop Systems

The purpose of this milestone is to create a closed loop system that can control the temperature of a temperature sensor located on the circuit, with a 5V regulator acting as a heating element and a brushless DC motor to cool it down. The milestone project bousts a modified bang-bang control scheme in which the PWM will decrease discretely as the error between the desired and measured temperatures. From this system, one can assign a desired value for the temperature of the sensor and the microprocessor will change the fan's duty cycle in order to cool or warm the sensor to the desired point with a steady state and little to no oscillation.
